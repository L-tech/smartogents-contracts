# Smartogents - AI-Powered Smart Contract Analyzer and Simulator

## Project Overview

Smartogents is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance the understanding, testing, and simulation of smart contracts on the Galadriel Devnet. By combining AI agents with smart contract analysis, Smartogents provides a comprehensive suite of features to assist developers and users in interacting with smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Contract ABI Upload and IPFS Storage**: Easily upload your contract ABI and store it on IPFS.
- **AI Agents for Comprehensive Contract Overviews and Simulations**: Get an overview of your contract from its ABI and ask questions for better understanding.
- **Utility Functions**:
  - Gas cost estimation
  - Security analysis with warnings and alerts for potential issues
  - Script generation for contract simulation and event logging
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate documentation for your contract based on its ABI.
- **Solidity Code Generation**: Generate Solidity code for similar contracts with custom requests.
- **NFT Reward**: Users who add contracts to the platform receive an NFT.

## Project Flow

1. **View Existing Contract List**: Check the list of existing contracts from the Contract ABI registry.
2. **Upload Contract**: If no contract is found, upload your contract to IPFS.
3. **Get Contract Overview**: Obtain an overview of the contract from its ABI and interact with AI agents to ask questions.
4. **Generate Documentation**: Automatically generate documentation for the contract using the AI agent web search.
5. **Script Generation**:
   - Generate scripts for contract simulation.
   - Create event loggers.
   - Estimate gas costs.
6. **NFT Reward**: The person who adds the contract to the platform receives an NFT.

## Future Functions

- **Solidity Code Generation**: Generate Solidity code for similar contracts with custom requests.
- **Security Analysis**: Perform security analysis to generate warnings and alerts for potential issues when interacting with the contract.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Contract ABI**: Upload your contract ABI through the user-friendly interface.
2. **Store on IPFS**: The uploaded ABI is stored on IPFS for decentralized access.
3. **Interact with AI Agents**: Use AI agents to get a comprehensive overview of your contract, simulate interactions, and estimate gas costs.
4. **Generate Documentation**: Automatically generate detailed documentation for your contract.
5. **Receive NFT Reward**: Get rewarded with an NFT for contributing to the platform by adding your contract.
